    "Across the playground, a group of Elves are working on setting up an ambitious Christmas decoration project. Through careful rigging, they have suspended a large number of small electrical junction boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their plan is to connect the junction boxes with long strings of lights. Most of the junction boxes don't provide electricity; however, when two junction boxes are connected by a string of lights, electricity can pass between those two junction boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elves are trying to figure out **which junction boxes to connect** so that electricity can reach **every** junction box. They even have a list of all of the junction boxes' positions in 3D space (your puzzle input).\n",

    "\n",
    "To save on string lights, the Elves would like to focus on connecting pairs of junction boxes that are **as close together as possible** according to straight-line distance. In this example, the two junction boxes which are closest together are `162,817,812` and `425,690,689`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The next two junction boxes to connect are `906,360,560` and `805,96,715`. After connecting them, there is a circuit containing 3 junction boxes, a circuit containing 2 junction boxes, and 15 circuits which contain one junction box each.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next two junction boxes are `431,825,988` and `425,690,689`. Because these two junction boxes were **already in the same circuit**, nothing happens!\n",

Multiplying together the sizes of the three largest circuits (5, 4, and one of the circuits of size 2) produces **40**.\n",
